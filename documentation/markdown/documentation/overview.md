# Documentation Overview
The Bashlib command line interface provides straightforward commands to interact with your Solid pod. 
It can be useful both for personal use, setting up small workflows or quick demonstrations of proof of concepts.
The authentication options enable quick switching between WebIDs and Solid Pods.
<br />
As not everything is optimized for performance, operations that target many resources or few but large resources 
may not be performant enough for some use-cases, as the internal resource management does not make use of streaming.
