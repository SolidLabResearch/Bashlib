# Welcome

Welcome to the Bashlib Homepage.

The documentation here is still incomplete both in content and structure, so feel free to open
a [discussion](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/Bashlib/issues/) about things you want to see added.
While we try to update this documentation together with updates in the code,
it is always possible we miss something,
so please report it if you find incorrect information or links that no longer work.

An introductory tutorial can be found
[here](tutorial.md).
This is a good way to get started with the server and its setup.
