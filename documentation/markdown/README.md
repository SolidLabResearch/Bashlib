# Welcome

Welcome to the Bashlib Homepage.

Bashlib is a Command Line Interface for working with Solid Pods, made by 
<a href="https://rubendedecker.be">Ruben Dedecker</a> at the
<a href="https://knows.idlab.ugent.be/">KNoWS team at Ghent University</a>. 

An introduction to quickly setting up a Community Solid Server instance and 
interfacing with it using Bashlib is found in <a href="./tutorial">the tutorial section</a>.

Documentation on the tool and the available commands is found in
<a href="./documentation/overview/">the documentation section</a>.

Documentation may be incomplete in content and structure.
